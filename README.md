#NutriPets

## Inspiration
Only 1 in 10 American adults eat enough fruits or vegetables, according to a new study published today in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Despite the United States being a first world country and having plenty of access to food, our society is unaware of the food's affect on our health. Unawareness is a risk for chronic diseases (7 of the top 10 leading causes of death in the U.S.), such as diabetes and heart disease. 

There is a heavy emphasis on teaching children to get proper nutrition, but very few Americans themselves eat the recommended amount every day.

## What it does
- Tracks daily intake of fruits and vegetables with a cute pet
- Taking care of the pet = feeding yourself
- Provides recommendations based on user's gender, age, and physical activity level
- Gives additional resources for users to gain more information regarding healthy eating habits

## How we built it
Android Studio
Youtube tutorials
Google and stackoverflow

## Challenges we ran into
It was so challenging that we can't even explain it
- Database manipulation
- Logic related coding

- Graphics formatting issues

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- First Hackathon
- Got over the database issue
- Having the app work in itself, leading to all the pages and activities that we wanted to
- Putting it together


## What we learned
- All of Android coding.. using Android studio

## What's next for NutriPets
